/*
 * The Proxy Pattern will provide an object a surrogate or placeholder for
 * another object to control access to it. This placeholder object is called
 * the “Proxy” for the real object.
 *
 * Proxy and the real object have the same interface.
 *
 * Proxy will be used to forward request to the real object, some times it also
 * manage life time of the real object.
 *
 * Most of time, proxy object should be transparent to user.
