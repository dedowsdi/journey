compile in windows
    open vs command prompt. cd to boost\tools\build\v2, Run: bootstrap.bat, this
    will generate b2.exe
    Run:  b2 install --prefix=PREFIX where PREFIX is the directory where you want
    Boost.Build to be installed, add Boost.Build/bin to path
    reopen vs command prompt, cd to boost, 
    Run: b2 --build-dir=build-directory toolset=toolset-name --build-type=complete
                    stage --with-libraryName

    build-dir:  Boost.Build will place all intermediate files it generates while
                            building into the build directory.  If your Boost root directory is
                            writable, this step isn't strictly necessary. Boost.Build will
                            create a bin.v2/ subdirectory
    stage: generate dll, lib in stage/lib
    toolset: compile tool
    build-type=complete¡± causes Boost.Build to build all supported variants of the
    libraries.  

    ex:  b2 stage toolset=msvc-11.0 --build-type=complete  --with-date_time 
    move the content of  stage/lib to boost/lib after compile
