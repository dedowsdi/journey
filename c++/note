1.  if you define friend function in class, it's implicitly inline.

2.  you never need a class definition to declare a function using that class,
    not even if the function passes or returns the class type by value

3.  you can only bind base ref to derived if derived public inherits base.

4.  function don't declare parameters that are truly arrays, but they can
    delcare parameters that are references to arrays.

5.  EBO only works in single inheritance

6.  before seeing whether a function is accessible, C++ first identifies the
    function that's the best match for the call. It checks accessibility only after
    finding the best-match function

7.  At most one user-defined conversion (constructor or conversion function) is
    implicitly applied to a single value.

8.  list is the only standard container that offers transactional semantics for
    multiple-element insertions.
    deque is the only standard STL container whose iterators may be invalidated
    without also invalidating its pointers and references
    
9.  during template function initialization, compilers are obliged to make sure
    that all source code(all branches) is valid, even if it's not executed

10. C++ guarantees it's always safe to delete the null pointer

11. placement new is used inside vector to create objects in the vector's unused
    capacity.

12. std::copy(.., std::ostream_iterator<T>(std::cout)) only works if:
        namespace std // required to be std
        {
            std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const T& t)
            {
                ..  
                return os;
            }
        }

13. copy initialization is not permitted to use explicit constructors.

14. if you delete cctor explicitly, you can't use copy initialization any more,
    very weird, as copy initialization doesn't call cctor.
