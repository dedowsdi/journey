							       *vector-insert*
when you insert something at iter to a vector, if the vector needs to be
reallocated, all iterators will be invalidated, otherwise only iteraters
starts from iter will be invalidated.

								     *linkage*
Internal linkage refers to everything only in scope of a translation unit.

External linkage refers to things that exist beyond a particular translation
unit. In other words, accessible through the whole program, which is the
combination of all translation units.

						       *template-access-super*
if your class is derived from template class, such as A<int>, and there is a
method called foo() in A<int>, you can not access foo directly in your
derived class, "foo" in derived class is a nondependent name, which mean
compiler won't search it in A<int>, there are 3 ways to access foo:

1. this->foo(). Since this is always implicitly dependent in a template,
   this->foo is dependent and the lookup is therefore deferred until the
   template is actually instantiated, at which point all base classes are
   considered
2. A<int>::foo to access. (shutdown virtual binding!)
3. call using A<int>::foo prior to foo();

						       *pragma-data-alignment*
change data alignment:
#pragma pack(push)
#pragma pack(1)

struct Data{
  ...
}

#pragma pack(pop)

							     *function-return*
be very careful with std::function:
std::function<const std::string&(const void*) > totally accepts
[](const void*)->std::string
this can cause local reference problem, total night mare.
  
							      *macro-function*
don't put space between macro function name and (

						  *template-nested-specialize*
you can not specialize nested template class without specialize outer class.
But a partial specialization of a nested class is allowed.

							   *lambda-c-function*
only lambda with blank catpure can be converted to c function

captureless lambda types are always implicitly convertible to functoin
pointer. If you absolutely need the function-pointer convertion to happen, add
a unary + before []. (there is no unary+ operator for lambda type, but there
is unary+ operator for ponter type, this trick deosn't work on msvc, because
there have 4 different calling convensions)

						   *macro-function-precedence*
you can define a macro in the same name as a global function. As the macro get
expanded, the global function will never be used.

							      *vector-pointer*
if you place object directly into container such as vector, be very very
  careful if you use pointer to such object, when vector space reallocated,
  all poiner wile be invallidated.

							*class-member-pointer*
You can use obj.*&Class::variableName to access obj.variableName.
You can use obj->*&Class::variableName to access obj->variableName.

eg:

template <class T, class S, class C>
const S& Container(const std::priority_queue<T, S, C>& q) {
  struct HackedQueue : private std::priority_queue<T, S, C> {
    static const S& Container(const std::priority_queue<T, S, C>& q) {
      // q.c won't work, as it's protected
      return q.*&HackedQueue::c;
    }
  };
  return HackedQueue::Container(q);
}

									*NRVO*
named return value optimization (NRVO) (copy elision) is commonly implemented by
compiler(don't have to). It's preferable to return by value, even in c++11.

									  *IB*
Implementation-defined Behaviour. The standard leaves it up to the
particular compiler/platform to define the precise behaviour, but requires
that it be defined.

Using implementation-defined behaviour can be useful, but makes your code less portable.

									  *UB*
Undefined Behaviour. The standard does not specify how a program invoking
undefined behaviour should behave. Also known as "nasal demons" because
theoretically it could make demons fly out of your nose.

									 *ADL*
ADL: argument dependent lookup
You don’t have to qualify the namespace for functions if one or more argument
types are defined in the namespace of the function.

							       *carray-return*
you can not return raw array with fixed size, but you can return std::array.

							     *const-temporary*
int a = 'a';
const char& b = a;
++a;
std::cout << b;
// will output 'a', because there is a temporary char that is bound to b, it
// happens if and b are not exactly the same type whose life time is expended
// to the life time of b.

							 *const-temporary-arg*
lifetime of temporary object will be extened by the first const reference
bound to it, it's destoryed after the life time of that const reference
expired, be very very careful about this, some function such as std::min or
std::max use const reference arg and return const renference , if you call
them with temporary object, the temporary object's life time will be extended
by the const reference arg, not the return one, it will be destoryed after
std::min finished, and it cause UB, it will be a nightmare.

std::min and std::max always return the 1st one if a and b are equivalence.
use std::minmax instead if that's not what you want

							*performance-division*
division is slowr than multiplication, but lots of compiler will optimize a
literal constant express, some even optimize for variables.

								  *prefix-sum*
prefix sum operation is an algorithm that, given an array of input values,
computes a new array where each element of the output array is the sum of all
of the values of the input array up to (and optionally including) the current
array element. A prefix sum operation that includes the current element is
known as an inclusive prefix sum, and one that does not is known as an
exclusive prefix sum.

							       *ag-accumulate*
becareful about std::accumulate(..., init), init is a template parameter, use
specific type, otherwise the result might be rounded



							      *value-category*
xvalue is expiring value, it must involves &&
xvalue + prvalue = rvalue
xvalue + lvalue = glvalue

							 *vector-reallocation*
during vector memory reallocation, the contents are moved if their move
constructor is noexcept.

							    *stl-size-compare*
after c++11, it always takes constant time to compare size() and 0 for all
stl container, why?

							       *vector-shrink*
reserve does nothing if new capacity is not greater then current
you can use shink_to_fit (might reallocate) or
vector(vec.begin(), vec.end()).swap(vec) to reduce capacity.

there is no guarantee that capacity is actually brought down exactly to size.
Capacity is really up to your STL implementation. But with these techniques,
it will be as small as it can get.

							    *unnamed-lifetime*
unamed object is created and destroyed immediately.

							     *inline-multiple*
if you want you can define inline multiple times, as long as they are all the
same.

							*return-const-pointer*
don't return const pointer type, ultimate function call will be an rvalue, and
rvalues of non-class type cannot be const, meaning that const will be ignored
anyway

						      *assignment-associative*
assignment is right-associative

							     *copy-assignment*
copy constructor will call parent copy constructor if you don't provider one,
copy assignment do nothing for parent part.

							       *lambda-inline*
lambda is inlined, just like inlined operator() in functor.

							*macro-compare-string*
you can not compare string in preprocessor

							  *booost-link-static*
if you need to link to static boost, check cmake::findBoost

							      *ctor-exception*
. If an exception is thrown during construction of an object, any parts of the
object that have already been fully constructed are automatically destroyed.

						       *function-pointer-size*
function pointer size depends on compiler!

								 *delete-null*
C++ guarantees it's always safe to delete the null pointer

								  *satic-init*
constructors and destructors of global and static variable  are called in a
totally unpredictable order.  constructors of global and static variable started
before main() is called A static variable that is declared within a function
will not be constructed before main() is called, but rather on the first
invocation of that function.

							      *static-integer*
class GamePlayer {
private:
  static const int NumTurns = 5;      // constant declaration
  int scores[NumTurns];               // use of constant
  ...
};

What you see above is a declaration for NumTurns, not a definition. Usually,
C++ requires that you provide a definition for anything you use, but
class-specific constants that are static and of integral type (e.g., integers,
chars, bools) are an exception. As long as you don't take their address, you
can declare them and use them without providing a definition. If you do take
the address of a class constant, or if your compiler incorrectly insists on a
definition even if you don't take the address, you must provide a separate
definition.

								*enum-address*
it's legal to take the address of a const, but it's not legal to take the
address of an enum, and it's typically not legal to take the address of a
#define, either.If you don't want to let people get a pointer or reference to
one of your integral constants, an enum is a good way to enforce that
constraint.

							     *global-constant*
(1)#define GLOBAL_CONST_VAR 0xFF
(2)int GLOBAL_CONST_VAR = 0xFF;
(3)Some function returning the value (e.g. int get_GLOBAL_CONST_VAR())
(4)enum { GLOBAL_CONST_VAR = 0xFF; }
(5)const int GLOBAL_CONST_VAR = 0xFF;
(6)extern const int GLOBAL_CONST_VAR; and in one source file const int
   GLOBAL_CONST_VAR = 0xFF;

(5) is "better" than (6) because it defines GLOBAL_CONST_VAR as an Integral
Constant Expression (ICE) in all translation units. For example, you will be
able to use it as array size and as case label in all translation units. In
case of (6) GLOBAL_CONST_VAR will be an ICE only in that translation unit where
it is defined and only after the point of definition. In other translation
units it won't work as ICE.

However, keep in mind that (5) gives GLOBAL_CONST_VAR internal linkage, meaning
that the "address identity" of GLOBAL_CONST_VAR will be different in each
translation unit, i.e. the &GLOBAL_CONST_VAR will give you a different pointer
value in each translation unit. In most usage cases this doesn't matter, but if
you'll need a constant object that has consistent global "address identity",
then you'd have to go with (6), sacrificing the ICE-ness of the constant in the
process.

Also, when the ICE-ness of the constant is not an issue (not an integral type)
and the size of the type grows larger (not a scalar type), then (6) usually
becomes a better approach than (5).
						*class-template-instantiation*
Nonvirtual functions are only instantiated if they’re used, but virtual
functions are instantiated every time.

						 *template-argument-deduction*
implicit type conversion functions are never considered during template
argument deduction.

							*caller-allocated-out*
example : std::string, std::vector

						   *default-include-directory*
find default search directory list for your version of CPP:
  cpp -v /dev/null -o /dev/null

							      *inline-virtual*
virtual functions can be inline if you call them via object.

							       *find-multiple*
find of multiset or multimap doesn't have to return the 1st one

							   *unorderd-same-key*
the elements with the same keys in unordered_map, unordered_set are guaranteed
to be consecutive in the iteration order.

							     *unordered-equal*
unordered* use equality, they offer a method to access their comparator:
key_eq.

							 *rference-collapsing*
template<typename T>
void foo(T const& t)

If you use foo<some_type&> to force T as an reference, type of t will be T&

(T&) const& collaped to T&
    T& is non const reference to T, you can change it
    (T&) const is reference T& that is const, the reference it self can't be
    modified, but the target is still modifiable, that's why it collapsed to
    T&

(T&&) const& also collaped to T&

be very very very careful about this.

From N4659 (2017-03-21) §11.3.2:
If a typedef-name (10.1.3, 17.1) or a decltype-specifier (10.1.7.2) denotes a
type TR that is a reference to a type T, an attempt to create the type “lvalue
reference to cv TR” creates the type “lvalue reference to T”, while an attempt
to create the type “rvalue reference to cv TR” creates the type TR. [ Note: This
  rule is known as reference collapsing. —end note ]

							     *function-assign*
void foo(){...}
decltype(foo) f = foo; // won't compile, you can't assign function,
		       // you can only assign function pointer
decltype(foo)* f = foo; // ok
decltype(&foo) f = foo; // ok too

				      *override-||* *override-&&* *override-,*
don't override ||,&&,and ',', if you override them, they become normal function,
the order of evaluation become unspecified(until c++17). built in || and && also have a
short-circuit to skip the right part, the override one doesn't.

arithmetic operators do not accept types smaller than int as arguments, and
integral promotions are automatically applied after lvalue-to-rvalue conversion,
if applicable.

when you compare int and std::vector::size, int will be converted to unsigned
first, be careful.

Macro argument: there is no requirement for square brackets or braces to
balance, and they do not prevent a comma from separating arguments.

									 *nan*
if a is NAN, a<b,a<=b,a>b,a>=b,a==b,a==a all return false

							    *float-complement*
0.0101 can be cauculated as 1 * 2^-2 + 1 * 2^-4 or float(0b0101) / 2^4

It's possible that cos(x) != cos(y) even though x == y, it's mainly because
float point register has more bits than double, when you store it into RAM, it's
truncated, if the comparison is done between RAM and float point register, you
are screwed. see https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/newbie#floating-point-arith2 for
detail.

c++ allow sizeof(char*) != sizeof(int*). Some hardware can't address bytes in
words, it's work might has 36 bits, it's char has 9 bits,  they use two word
char*, first pointer to word, second shift the address.

reading the last byte from a file might not set the eof state, don't rely on it.

for(item : set) won't handle remove for you, be careful.
