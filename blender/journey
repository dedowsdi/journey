export
    blender only use z up cyliner and capsule, it costs a lot of trouble to export

    if your scene have no cylinder or capsule physics shape:

        select all, pitch -90, apply rotation,  then export scene and physics,
        select xyz export,  everything is fine.

    if your scene has cylinder or capsule physics shape:

        well, you can not apply rotation , it will destroy the physics. The
        mesh exported will be z up

    so,  for scene only geometry, i should just use z up coordinate system

export bullet
    script:
        import bge
        bge.constraints.exportBulletFile("test.bullet")

    step1. edit python script
    step2. add a "always" sensor and python controller, set up script
    step3. run game engine("p")

 
use height map:
    make sure import-export: import image as plane is toggled
    create a plane, sub dividie it n times
    file/import/images as plane
    add modifier/deform/displace, use tex, adjust strength

create height map:
    after prepare terrain
    remove light, select camera, clear rotation, translation
    change camera type to ortho, chage scale so camera can just cover entire terrain
    add material, toggle shader less, choose smooth render
    add a blender texture, change mapping to z z z
    toggle color ramp, adjust alpha to 1
    f12, f3, choose BW, save
