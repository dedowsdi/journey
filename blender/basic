mesh

Duplication Vertices or DupliVerts  duplication of a base object at the location of the vertices of a parent mesh, base object will not be rendered in blender.
                                    we can make duplicate real by select parent mesh,  ctrl + shift + a (object/apply/make duplicate real)
                                    the same rule for duplication faces, it's safe to apply rotation, scale, location of base object before this

DupliFrames                         duplicate objects at frames distributed along a path(like bezier curve)
                                    path animation frame number will control duplicate numbers
                                    disable speed under frame, this will work somehow like duplicate vertices
                                    enable speed , and select follow path when parenting, this will generaet animation
insert vertex                       ctrl + lmb, new vertice will be connected with current selected vertex
                                    the new vertex is placed at the depth of the 3D cursor, the same rule for edge and face

                                Only Edges & Faces          Limits the operation to only selected edges and adjacent faces.
                                Edge Collapse               Collapses edges into single vertices. This can be used to remove a loop of faces.
                                Edge Loop                   Deletes an edge loop.
                                                            If the current selection is not an edge loop, this operation does nothing. connected faces wil not be removed
convert triangles to quad       alt + j. This same action can be done on a selection of just 1 tris, by selecting them and using the shortcut F,

rip                             v.  Rip creates a ¡°hole¡± into a mesh by making a copy of selected vertices and edges, still linked to the neighbor non-selected vertices
                                so that the new edges are borders of the faces on one side, and the old ones, borders of the faces of the other side of the rip.
                                can available for vertex or edge
rip fill                        alt + v.(not supported for blender 2.63)    the same as rip, but the hole will be filled                                    
split                           y. It makes a sort of copy of the selection, removing the original face if it's in face mode
seperate                        p. select from current mesh, generate a new mesh
vertex connect                  j.   Vertex Connect takes two vertices that share a face, and creates an edge between the two, splitting the face into two new faces.

                                This tool translates selected vertices/edges/faces along their own normal (perpendicular to the face), 
                                which, on ¡°standard normal meshes¡±, will shrink/fatten them.

                                You can flip to the opposite vertex using F. using alt + mmw to change control edge
                                    f: When Even mode is active, this flips between the two adjacent edge loops the active edge loop will match
rotate edg                      ctrl + e, Rotating an edge clockwise or counter-clockwise spins an edge between two faces around their vertices. 
bridge edge loops               connects multiple edge loops with faces.

                                It rearrange selected triangles to obtain more ¡°balanced¡± ones (i.e. less long thin triangles).                     
grid fill                       Grid Fill uses a pair of connected edge-loops to fill in a grid that follows the surrounding geometry. 
solidify                        This takes a selection of faces and solidifies them by extruding them uniformly to give volume to a non-manifold surface.               
                                It's different from exturde, faces are extruded along their own normal ,but not seperately, then are still connected

                            Perfect Screw Spindles use a profile with the same height as its vector, 
                            and the beginning and ending vertex of the profile are placed at a straight parallel line with the axis of extrusion.

                             because of their nondestructive nature; only when the Apply button
                            in the Modifiers panel is clicked do modifiers affect the real vertices of the final mesh.

multiresolution             mostly used with sculpting purpose, subdivide will dived 1 plane into 4
                            Preview is for the main 3D view, Sculpt is for when Sculpt mode is being used, and

scale envelop   infulence           ctrl + alt + s, not working in ubentu. also can be change in /bone/deform   
scale envelop bone                  alt + s     
weight vertex bind                  chose vertex group in armature modifier, select bone, switch to pose mode, shift+rmb select object, switch to paint mode
flip select                         shift + f
select parent/child                 []
create ik                           first clear parent of target bone, chose original parent of target bone, add ik bone constraint(ctrl+i)
                                    set target to target bone. Adjust chain length to affected bone numbers. remove ik by ctrl+shift+i
                                    create a pole bone, so armatures bend in the right direction, set up pole bone in ik constraint.
                                    you might need to change pole angle if your bone didn't point to th epole.
auto ik                             you can turn on this in T in pose mode. an auto ik will be created whenever you pick a bone, the bone
                                    you picked is your target, the ikchain extend until the connedt most parent bone
                                    be careful, auto id conficts with ik constraint
auto ik chain                       you can break auto ik chain by toggle off conenct in bone/Relations, this will keep parenting, but allow
                                    child bone grab away from parent, so it will break ik chain here
mirror x                            toggle x mirror in T, then shift+E to extrude
remember to recalcate z after build all bone to eliminate barrel roll
don't forget to turn on x-mirror when you do weight-paint
subsurface modifier should below armature   
weight paint                        turn off face, set weight and strength to 1, weight paint only paint on real geometry vertex
reset reset pose                    ctrl+a, apply apply pose to reset pose in pose mode.
                                    every change you did on edit mode will take effect on reset pose
never scale armature after you set up animation, parent armature to mesh, scale mesh instead

¡ö Note As with polygon objects, if you are in edit mode when adding or duplicating items, they become part of
the object you are editing. You should be in object mode when adding new items to ensure they really are
separate objects.           

blender is case sensitive in naming
when signate vertex group, you can select face instead of vertex, it's much more easier         

Note
If you alter the Bone Envelope volume of a bone so that you can have it include/exclude certain vertices
after you have already used Armature Deform With Envelope Weights, 
by default the newly included/excluded vertices wont be effected by the change. 
When using Armature Deform With Envelope Weights it only calculates which vertices will be affected by the Bone Envelope volume
 at the time of parenting, at which point it creates the required named Vertex Groups and assigns vertices to them as required. 
 If you want any vertices to take account of the new Bone Envelope volume size 
 you will have carry out the Armature Deform With Envelope Weights parenting again; 
 In fact all parenting used in the Set Parent To popup dialog which tries to automatically assign vertices to Vertex Groups works like this.                

A datablock can become unlinked. For example a material datablock will be unlinked if the object it was linked to is deleted. If a datablock is unlinked, by default it will be deleted from the .blend file when Blender is closed. To keep an unlinked datablock in a .blend file, click the "F" button to the right of the object's name in the Objects and Links panel.

collapse menu       a
