1.6.1-15. state whether the indicated functoin is continuous at 3. if not, why.
  1.6.1. f(x) = (x-3)(x-4)
    f is polynomial, it's continuous on R, so it's continusous on 3.

  1.6.10 f(x) = (21-7x)/(x-3)
    f is rational, it's continuous on R except x=3, so it's not continuous on 3.

1.6.18-23. the given function is not defined at a certain point. How should it be defined in order to make it continuous
at that point?
  1.6.20 g(x) = sinx/x
    sinx is C on R, x is C on R, so g(x) is C on R except 0
    so define g(0) = lim_x_0(g(x)) = 1 will make it continuous at 0.

1.6.24-34. at what points, if any, are the functions discontinuous?
  1.6.30 f(x) = 1/sqrt(4+x^2)
    norminator and denominator are both continuous on R, denominator always >0, so f is continuous on R.

1.6.41-48. determine whether the function is continuous at the given point c. ifnot, determine whether the
discontinunity is removable or nonremovable.
  1.6.45. g(x) = sinx/x,  x != 0
               = 0,       x = 0
          c = 0
    sinx and x is both C on R, so g is C if x != 0
    if x = 0, lim_x_0(g(x)) = 1 != g(0)
    redefine g(0) = 1 wile make it continuous on R, so 0 is removable on g.

1.6.62. let f(x) = 1/(x-1), then f(-2) = 1/3, f(2) = 1. Does the Intermediate Value Theorem imply the existence of a
number c between -2 and 2 such taht f(c) = 0 ? Explain.
  1 and x-1 is C on R, f is C on R except on 1, 1 ∈ [-2,1], so f is not C on [-2,1], so you can not apply Intermediate

  F(x) = 8(x^2 + y^2) - 100(x^2-y^2) = 0
  dy/dx = -(∂F/∂x)/(∂F/∂y) = -(16(x^2+y^2)2x - 200x)/(16(x^2+y^2)2y + 200y) = (25x-4x(x^2+y^2))/(25y+4y(x^2+y^2))
  dy/dx_(3,1) = -9/13
  k of normal line = 13/9
  f(x) = 13/9 * (x-3) + 1

  you can also solve this problem by ∇, as ∇ is normal line of level curve
  ∇f = (∂F/∂x,∂F/∂y)) ==> k = (∂F/∂y)/(∂F/∂x)

  V = π/3 * h * (400 + 5h + 400 + 400 + 10h + h^2/16)

sketch the graph of the given function on the given interval.
  3.6.1. f(x) = |x|; [1,2]

  3.6.10 f(x) = (x-4)/(x-3); [0,4]
    f(3) doesn't exist, so f(x) is not C on [0,4], so mean value theroem doesn't apply.

  assume a <= c0 < c1 <= b, f(c0) = f(c1) = 0,
  ∵ f is C on [c0, c1], D on (c0, c1)
  ∴ exist point d ∈ (c0, c1) that f'(d) = (f(c1) - f(c0)) / (c1 - c0) = 0
  ∵ a<= c0 < d < c1 <= b, f'(d) = 0

12.6.20. Sand is pouring onto a conical pile in sucha a way that at a certain instant thte height is 100 inches and
increasing at 3 inches per minute and the base radius is 40 inches and increasing at 2 inches per minute. How fast is
the volume increasing at that instant ?
  V = πr^2h/3
  dv/dt = ∇ V(r,h) · (dr/dt, dh/dt)
        = (2πrh/3, πr^2/3) · (2, 3)
        = 20800π/3

    (4,6, 2sqrt(3))·( x-2, y-3, z - sqrt(3) = 0

12.7.9-12. use the total differential dz to papproximate the change in z as (x,y) moves from P to Q. Then use a
calculator to find the corresponding exact change Δz.

  ∇f0(0, -1, 2) = (0, 4, 4) = n0
  ∇f1(x,y,z) = (2x, 2y, 2z-6)
  ∇f1(0, -1, 2) = (0, -2, -2) = n1
  ∵ n0 = -2n1
  ∵ two share the same point and has collinear normal must be the same plane
  ∴ ...

  g(x,y,z) = 2x^2 - y^2 + 3z^2 - 10 = 0
  at the point(1,2,2)
  ∵ the line is tangent to curve in both surface
  ∴ the line is perpendicular to both gradiant
  ∇f(x,y,z) = (18x, 8y, 8z)
  ∇f(1,2,2) = (18, 16, 16) = 2(9,8,8)

12.8.1.10. find all critical points. Indicate whether weach such point gives a local maximum or a local minimum, or
whether it is a saddle point.
  12.8.1. f(x,y) = x^2 + 4y^2 -4x
    f has not bondary point and singular point
    ∇f(x,y) = (2x-4, 8y)
    set ∇f = 0, gives stationary point (2,0)
    f_xx = 2, f_yy = 8, f_xy = 0
    D = f_xx*f_yy - f_xy^2 = 16
    ∵ D>0, f_xx>0
    ∴ (2,0) is global minimal point.

12.8.11-14. find the global maximum value and global minimum value of f on S and indicate where each occurs.
  f(x,y) = 3x + 4y; S = {(x,y): 0<=x<=1, -1<=y<=1}
    ∇f(x,y) = (3,4)
