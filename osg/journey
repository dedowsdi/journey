make sure you specify array binding when you set it to geometry.

If you put light in light source, it will be global.
If you use light as an attribute, it will be local.

there are 3 kins of billboard:
    point_rot_eye : look at camera from billboard, use camera up as up in lookat
    point_rot_world: rotate normal to center to eye, don't care about orientation
    axial_rot : rotate around certain axis
billboard should be created in xz plane, use (0,-1,0) as normal

If you want to change geometry data, make sure to set geometry data variance to dynamic.
