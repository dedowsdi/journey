print column or field, starts from 1, specific field can appear multiple times
in any place
    awk '{print $3 "\t" $4}'

print all
    awk '{print $0}'

print lines that match pattern
    awk '/a/ {print $0}'

print columns that match pattern
    awk '/a/ {print $4 "\t" $3}'

count matching lines
    awk '/a/ {++cnt} END{print "Count = ", cnt}'
    noate that there is no need to declare a variable before using it.
    it's print not printf in END block, "," can be used to seperate print items
    by space

print lines with more than 24 characters
    awk 'length($0) > 24'
    print is default program?
