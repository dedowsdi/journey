Branching Policy
  The main line of development is the master branch in the primary repository.
  The master branch always contains the latest, potentially unstable work.

  When a version release is impending, a feature freeze happens, and a separate
  openmw-x (where x is the version number) branch is created. Only bugfixes and
  well-tested or non-disruptive changes are accepted into that branch.

  Developers who want to work on a new feature or a bug-fix are requested to
  created a new topic branch based either on the master or the openmw-x branch.
  Usually the master branch should be chosen over the openmw-x branch. But when
  in doubt, please ask on the development forum.

  The topic branch shall be given a short, descriptive, all-lowercase name.

  Additional topic branches should branch off from the master / openmw-x branch,
  unless they depend on another topic branch.

  Once a topic branch is ready, the developer should issue a pull request on
  github into the target branch of the primary repository. If you are unsure if
  the branch is ready, ask on the forum first.

------------------
Naming Conventions
  Files
    header files: somefile.hpp
    source files: somefile.cpp
    No CamelCase and no underscores, please.

  Names
    Namespaces
      Example: ThisIsANamespace

    Namespaces in apps/openmw will have a MW-prefix (MWThisIsANamespace).
    Obviously you should try to keep these names short, but don't use hard to
    read abbreviations.

    Classes
      Example: ThisIsAClass

    Functions
      Example: thisIsAFunction

    Local Variables & Parameters
      Example: thisIsAVariable

    Member Variables
      Non-static: mThisIsAVariable

    Static: sThisIsAVariable

    Note that formally the name of the variable would still be thisIsAVariable.
    The m and the s are scope sigils. Some other languages (e.g. Ruby) provide
    these as part of the syntax. C doesn't, so we have to encode them in the
    name. And no, this is not Hungarian notation.

  Global Variables
    Shame on you!

  Enums
    Example:

    TypePrefix_SomeName
    TypePrefix_SomeOtherName
    TypePrefix_AndSomeMore
    The TypePrefix should be chosen appropriately for the purpose of the enum.
    Don't use all uppercase names. These would make the enums look like
    preprocessor constants.

  Preprocessor constants
  Example: THISISACONSTANT

  Since preprocessor constants are the only part of the language that does not
  respect namespaces, these must be clearly distinguished from everything else.

  Don't use these for anything but include guards and conditional compiling.

  Acronyms
    Acronyms in names should follow the guidelines on this page too, even if
    that is not how you would normally write them, e.g.: a class representing a
    NPC would be called Npc. Otherwise it would look like a preprocessor macro.

  Abbreviations
    Please avoid cryptic abbreviations. iter and i are okay. Well known acronyms
    from the RPG terminology are okay too (but see above for advice on
    capitalisation). Other abbreviations should be avoided. Don't be afraid of
    long names!

---------------------------
Code Formatting Conventions
  Layout & Indention
  This is an example of the layout & indention style we encourage.

   namespace SomeSpace
   {
       class SomeClass
       {
           private:
              int mSomeVar;
    
           public:
              float someFunction(float p1, float p2) const;
       };
   }

   namespace SomeSpace
   {
       float SomeClass::someFunction(float p1, float p2) const
       {
           return p1 + p2;
       }
   }
  Note that the indention width is 4 spaces. If you use tabs instead of
  spaces, our build server will reject your code. Mixing spaces and tabs is
  not good.

  Includes
    An implementation file (cpp) should always start by including its own
    header.

    Further includes should be grouped. Groups must be separated by an empty
    line.

    C headers (if any) should be listed before the C++ headers.
    If more than one external library is used, each library's headers should
    be put into a separate group.

    use following sequence to include heades
      Standard C and C++ headers
      External libraries headers
      Components headers
      Apps headers
      Local headers

  ----------------
  Doxygen Comments
    Class definitions and function declarations should have doxygen comments. We
    aren't very strict about this though (especially for trivial functions).

    A class should be documented like this:

      /// \brief short description
      ///
      /// Longer description.
      class SomeClass

    The longer description can be skipped, if there is nothing more to say.

    A function should be documented like this:
      /// Description.
      void someFunction();

    Here is a link to the Doxygen Documentation.
      http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html
    Please make plenty of use of the listed commands, especially the following:
      \a
      \attention
      \brief
      \note
      \p
      \param
      \return
      \todo

------------------
Other Coding Rules
  Namespaces
    We prefer fully qualified names (e.g. std::cout).

    Using directives (e.g. "using namespace std") are not welcome. Using
    directives in headers will result in the code being rejected.

    Using declarations (e.g. "using std::cout") are tolerated, but should be
    used only in the innermost possible scope (i.e. usually function scope).
    Fully qualified names are still preferred.

    Do not declare any names in the global namespace (the only exception to this
    rule is the file which contains the main() function of an executable).

  Other Pieces of Advice
    Prefer C++ means over C means. In particular:
      Do not use the preprocessor for purposes other than conditional compiling (this
      includes include guards)
      Use C++ streams instead of C I/O
      Use new/delete instead of malloc/free (but usage of new/delete should also be
      limited, see below)
    Prefer STL-container over raw arrays and new[]/delete[].
    Use new/delete only when necessary. Prefer automatic storage duration.
    Throw exceptions instead of retuning error codes.
    When returning a pointer, don't return a 0-pointer in case of an error
    (returning a 0-pointer is still valid, if it does not represent an error
    situation).
    Remember the Rule of Three.




Apps: The OpenMW project consists of multiple applications/tools:
  1 openmw : the actual game
  2 openmw-launcher : a launcher for openmw
  3 esmtool : a esm/esp file analysis tool (command line only).
  4 bsatool : A bsa file analysis tool (command line only).
  5 openmw-cs :  A replacement for the Morrowind Construction Set.
  6 openmw-iniimporter : An importer for Morrowind.ini files.
  7 openmw-essimporter : An importer for vanilla Morrowind save files. Currently
                         in early stages - imported saves will be missing functionality,
  8 openmw-wizard : An installation wizard for the game files that are required
                    to run OpenMW.

Components
  A collection of reusable components. Most of these components are used by more
  than one application within the OpenMW project.

  An ideal component is self-contained with no additional dependencies on the
  OpenMW codebase. In some cases depending on another component is OK.

Extern
  The Extern subsystem consists of libraries that are not part of the OpenMW
  project, but of which a copy is kept in the repository anyway:

  oics
    Fork of the OIS Input Control System project, a library that makes it easy
    to handle input configurations for mouse, keyboard and joysticks by routing
    bindings through abstract channels. We use it for OpenMW's in-game key
    binding menu. When OpenMW switched to SDL2 input, modifications to oics were
    made to use SDL2 for input in place of OIS.

  osg-ffmpeg-videoplayer
    A port of the ogre-ffmpeg-videoplayer project, which is now in extern/ for
    historical reasons. We might move it to components/ at some point.
    
-----------
world model

  ---------------------------------------------
  there are two kinds of terminology in openmw:

  --
  MW:
    id
      A certain type of item, which is internally represented as a record.  Each
      ID is identified by a unique string. IDs are immutable. Example:
      katana_goldbrand_unique

    reference
      An instance of an ID, that exists either somewhere in the world or in a
      container/inventory. A reference consists of the name of its ID and some
      additional data. References are mutable. Not to be confused with C++
      references.  Example: The sword Goldbrand that you have in your inventory
      after finishing the Boethiah quest in Morrowind.

  ---
  NEW:
    class
      the same as id in MW. there is a c++ class per type of class.

    object
      the same as reference in MW.

    instance
      the same as object.

  -------------
  Record store:
    The world model is split in two parts: An immutable part and a mutable part.
    The record store represents the immutable part.

    The esm/esp file format contains a list of records, where each record is
    composed of a type ID and additional data. Our world model does mirror this
    structure.

    Individual records can by identified by a string ID, a numeric ID, a
    coordinate-pair or not at all (depending on the type).

    For each type of record we have a struct in the ESM namespace:
    http://zinnschlag.github.com/openmw/namespaceESM.html

    For each type of record we also have a list of these records, instantiating
    the MWWorld::Store template. There are some variations depending on the
    record type.

    The class implementing the record store is named ESMStore (in the MWWorld
    namespace). The ESMStore merges records from multiple ESM/ESP files into a
    single store. The merging implementation can vary depending on the record
    type.

    A const reference to the current ESMStore can be obtained from the
    MWBase::World class instance.

  ----------------
  Dynamic Records:
    Some types of records can be generated dynamically during gameplay and then
    accessed via the record store like any other record.
    Examples:
      custom classes
      custom enchantments
      potions created by alchemy
      modifications to levelled lists via the console

  ----
  Cell
    A cell record consists of some header-type data fields and a collection of
    references. Of these only the header data is stored in the record store. The
    collection of references is mutable and as such needs to be treated
    separately.

  ----
  Info
    For every practical purpose each info record is a sub-records of a dialogue
    record. The OpenMW info storage implementation reflects this structure. The
    esm/esp format does not.

  -----
  Cells

  The World of an OpenMW game is composed of cells. Each cell consists of an
  immutable part (stored in the record store) and a list of objects, which make
  up the mutable part of the world model.

    -----------
    Terminology

    An active cell refers to a cell that is in the currently rendered scene.  A
    cell being loaded refers to the objects in the cell having been loaded from
    the game files, ready to be used by scripts or other means. Once loaded, a
    cell is never unloaded, unless you start a new game or load another saved
    game. Note: some code/other documentation that may not be particularly
    concerned with the world model will incorrectly use the term 'loaded' as
    meaning 'active', do not confuse the two!

    ---------------------
    Interiors & Exteriors
    These are the differences between interior and exterior cells:

    Interior cells are accessed by an ID, which is identical to the user-visible
    cell name. (except for the Russian version of Morrowind, which uses a
    separate translation mechanism)
    Exterior cells are accessed by a coordinate pair and can have an optional
    name. Exterior cells are arranged in the regular grid which can have holes
    and an irregular outline.
    Only exterior cells have terrain
    The sky is optional in interior cells
    Only one interior cell can be active at any time. In this case no exterior
    cells can be active
    Multiple exterior calls can be active at the same time (in the default
    configuration the cell the player is in and the eight neighbouring cells).
    In this case no interior cell can be active.

  -------
  Objects

  The mutable part of the world model is made up from objects (called references
  in the original MW terminology). An object can either be located in a cell or
  in a container (which is also located in a cell).

  Each cell and each container keeps a separate list for each record type that
  can be referenced. Each list is made up from a sequence of ESMS::LiveCellRef
  objects (specialized for the respective record type). Please note that the
  LiveCellRef only contains the persistent state. State only valid while the
  object is in an active cell is stored elsewhere.

  There is no polymorphism used here, which is a design flaw that originated at
  a very early development stage and could not be fixed anymore without a total
  rewrite, once everyone agreed that it was a flaw. Various workarounds are in
  place now.

  ---------------------
  Unified Object Access

  Unified access to objects is possible through the MWWorld::Ptr class. There
  are several ways to obtain a Ptr:
    directly from an object in a cell or a container
    via the record ID (all referencable records have string IDs), if there is only
    one object of this record
    for NPCs and Creatures, via a CreatureStats::ActorId

  --------------
  MWWorld::Class

  Another workaround is the MWWorld::Class hierarchy. Through the static
  function MWWorld::Class::get from a Ptr a suitable instance of a derived
  Class-class can be obtained that polymorphically implements record type
  specific behaviour.

  ------
  Player

  The player is a special object that references a record of the type NPC. The
  player is by definition always in an active cell.

  The player object is not stored within the list of objects of that cell.
  Instead it is handled separately by the World class. This can be ignored most
  of the time though. The player can be access like any other object via its ID
  "player". The world class also provides a function that returns the player's
  MWWorld::Ptr.

  Please note that the esm/esp files don't contain a player object. Instead this
  object is inserted when the player begins a new game.

  ---------------------
  Rendering Archiecture

    ------------------------
    Threading considerations
      The default threading model in OpenSceneGraph, DrawThreadPerContext,
      requires some care when dealing with modifications to rendering data
      (Drawables and StateSets). Any such data that is currently in (or has been
      in) the scene graph (referred to as 'live' data) must be assumed as unsafe
      to modify because it could be in use by the drawing thread.

      What is not allowed:
        Modify a live StateSet (e.g. by adding/removing StateAttributes or
        modifying a contained StateAttribute) 
        Modify a live Drawable in a way that affects its drawing implementation

      What is allowed:
        Remove a Drawable from, or add it to the scene graph (the scene graph
        itself is not part of rendering data) (un)assign a StateSet from a node
        - the StateSets used for a rendering traversal are stored separately, so
        this is fine.  Make harmless modifications that don't affect the
        renderer, like adding callbacks, changing names, etc. Still be very
        careful, though.

      Whenever you are dealing with a bug that you think may be
      threading-related, you can use the OSG_THREADING=SingleThreaded
      environment variable to test your theory. As long as you stick to the
      above rules, though, you shouldn't run into any issues.

      To make actual modifications, one of the following techniques may be used:

        Clone the original object and modify that copy. This is perfect for
        infrequent modifications when we don't care about the performance
        overhead of object cloning/deletion.

           osg::ref_ptr<osg::StateSet> newStateSet = new osg::StateSet(*stateset, osg::CopyOp::SHALLOW_COPY); osg::BlendFunc*
           blendFunc = static_cast<osg::BlendFunc*>(stateset->getAttribute(osg::StateAttribute::BLENDFUNC));
           osg::ref_ptr<osg::BlendFunc> newBlendFunc = blendFunc ?  new osg::BlendFunc(*blendFunc) : new osg::BlendFunc;
           newBlendFunc->setDestinationAlpha(osg::BlendFunc::ONE);
           newStateSet->setAttribute(newBlendFunc, osg::StateAttribute::ON);
           node.setStateSet(newStateSet);

        Use a double buffering technique to manage access. We have a
        StateSetUpdater class that implements this technique for StateSets.

            class AtmosphereUpdater : public SceneUtil::StateSetUpdater
            {
            public:
                void setEmissionColor(const osg::Vec4f& emissionColor)
                {
                    mEmissionColor = emissionColor;
                }

            protected:
                virtual void setDefaults(osg::StateSet* stateset)
                {
                    stateset->setAttributeAndModes(createAlphaTrackingUnlitMaterial(), osg::StateAttribute::ON|osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE);
                }

                virtual void apply(osg::StateSet* stateset, osg::NodeVisitor* /*nv*/)
                {
                    osg::Material* mat = static_cast<osg::Material*>(stateset->getAttribute(osg::StateAttribute::MATERIAL));
                    mat->setEmission(osg::Material::FRONT_AND_BACK, mEmissionColor);
                }

            private:
                osg::Vec4f mEmissionColor;
            };

      Rather than changing the object itself, inject the change on the fly where
      it's needed, e.g. into the CullVisitor by using a CullCallback.
        https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/blob/ada85aa1ee24e32435083cf644faece988ba9a27/apps/openmw/mwrender/sky.cpp#L742

      Set the object's dataVariance to DYNAMIC, so that the draw traversal knows
      that it has to synchronize that object. Never do this in performance
      critical areas, or at all, really. Just one DYNAMIC object will make the
      threading useless and probably halve your frame rate.

  --------------------
  Important components
    
    ------------
    SceneManager
      The SceneManager is where game object's rendering nodes (.nif or .osg) are
      loaded, prepared, optimized and instanced, then stored in cache for future
      use. Instancing refers to making a copy of the object that is safe to use
      and modify, while the original 'template' object remains read-only.

      A state sharing mechanism is employed that will share StateSets across
      different objects in order to improve rendering efficiency. This means
      that for any object loaded through the SceneManager it is not safe to
      modify its StateSets because they could also be in use by another object.
      It is advised to create a copy of the StateSet before making a
      modification (just as discussed in Threading considerations). The
      StateSetUpdater already does this for you by creating a copy of the
      StateSet on the first frame its used.

    ---------
    Optimizer
      The optimizer's job is to restructure a scenegraph in a way that is
      functionally equivalent yet increases the rendering speed. It does this
      for example by merging Geometries with the same StateSet into one
      Geometry, removing redundant nodes, and so on. The Optimizer is run
      automatically on any object loaded through the SceneManager.

      It has been known to happen that the optimizer contained bugs, which are
      then (usually) promptly fixed. These bugs could cause objects to render
      incorrectly, cause incorrect collisions or spam warnings on the console.
      In order to check if a bug is related to the Optimizer, we can run OpenMW
      with the OPENMW_OPTIMIZE=OFF environment variable. If the bug disappears
      with that flag, we can further narrow down which specific optimization may
      be causing it, by disabling them in order:

      OPENMW_OPTIMIZE="~MERGE_GEOMETRY"
      OPENMW_OPTIMIZE="~MERGE_GEOMETRY|~REMOVE_REDUNDANT_NODES" # If the bug
      does not appear now, the first optimization (FLATTEN_STATIC_TRANSFORMS)
      has to be the culprit.

    ---------
    Utilities
      Aside from the optimizer, the sceneutil/ directory contains many more
      OpenSceneGraph "extensions" made for OpenMW purposes, for example our
      lighting system. It is a good idea to be familiar with these.

      There is also a scene graph debugger (invoked in-game with the "showSceneGraph"
      (ssg) console command), this will print out the scene graph representation of
      any given object, or even the whole scene (if no object is given). The results
      are printed to a text file.

  ----------------
  GUI Architecture

    -------------
    Layout system
      MyGUI's XML format for layouts/skins has been used for the majority of the
      OpenMW GUI. The resulting files can be found at openmw/files/mygui.
      Currently the formats are lacking a complete documentation, but the amount
      of examples that are available should more or less make up for this.

      MyGUI includes a Layout Editor and Skin Editor application, but
      unfortunately these tools are difficult to use for us due to specifics of
      the Morrowind GUI resources, e.g. BSA archives and case insensitivity. In
      the past we made a MyGUI plugin to work around this, which can still be
      found in the 'plugins' directory of the OpenMW code. However, this plugin
      is currently not working as it has not been updated after OpenMW switched
      to OpenSceneGraph rendering. So for the time being, XML files have to be
      edited by hand (which, admittedly, is more convenient in many cases
      anyway).

      The coordinates in MyGUI layouts (left, top, width, height - always in
      that order) are given in pixels and relative to the parent widget. The GUI
      system internally works in pixels, even if GUI Scaling is enabled. The GUI
      scaling option works by pretending to the GUI that the screen is smaller
      than it really is, and then using the graphics card to do the scaling.

      Widgets also have an Align property. The Align does not have any effect on
      the initial placement of the widget, rather, it controls what will happen
      when the parent widget changes size. For example, if the parent widget's
      width increases by 1 pixel, and our widget is set to 'HStretch', its width
      will also increase by 1 pixel. If in that same example our widget instead
      uses 'Right' then the widget will move to the right by 1 pixel. Here is
      the list of possible alignments
        http://mygui.info/docs/struct_my_g_u_i_1_1_align.html#a31d25cd20fcd3d2782d864dd63b3be0a
      , which can sometimes be combined for example 'Left Bottom'.

      Please note that most of OpenMW's skin files were written using a
      deprecated syntax. The now preferred and more powerful syntax is the
      ResourceLayout, for which an example can be found at openmw_resources.xml.
      This syntax more closely resembles the one used for layout files.

      Apart from using skin/layout files it is still required to use C++ code in
      order to connect widget events to certain actions. The code for this can
      be found in the openmw/apps/openmw/mwgui/
          
  -------------
  Box layouting
    Because the above mentioned pixel-based layouting system can be a bit too
    limited and cumbersome for some cases, we have created a new box-layout
    system for OpenMW's purposes that functions similar to the way traditional
    GUI toolkits like Qt or GTK work. It is usually preferred to use this system
    for new layouts instead of positioning widgets by hand. The new system
    introduces the following widgets:

  ----------
  HBox, VBox
    Automatically positions and resizes their child widgets, horizontally or
    vertically. Available user strings are 'Spacing' (empty space between each
    widget), 'Padding' (outer padding), and 'AutoResize'. If 'AutoResize' is
    true, the box resizes itself to the requested size of the child widgets.
    Otherwise, the box will stay at its given size.

    Child widgets can set the user string 'HStretch' (for HBox) or 'VStretch'
    (for VBox). If stretching is enabled, the widget will fill up all the space
    available to it. Otherwise, the widget will remain in its original size i.e.
    the box will only control that widget's position.

    Boxes can be nested within each other e.g. to produce a table layout.

  ---------------
  AutoSizedButton
    This widget will resize itself to fit its label.

    Text padding defaults to (24, 8) but can be overriden by the 'TextPadding'
    user string.

    If the 'ExpandDirection' user string is set to 'Left' then the button will
    accordingly move to the left upon expanding its size (or to the right on
    contracting). This is only relevant if the button is not part of a Box.

  ----------------
  AutoSizedEditBox
    Like AutoSizedButton, but for multi-line text. The widget's width is static,
    but the height will be adjusted based on the number of lines required.

  ------
  Spacer
    An empty widget for use with HBox/VBox that fills all available space.
    Spacers can be used to set the alignment of sibling widgets. For example, a
    box containing a spacer, a button and another spacer (in that order) results
    in a centered button.

  ----------------
  Escape sequences
    As the MyGUI
    wiki(http://wiki.ogre3d.org/tiki-index.php?page=MyGUI+text+formatting)
    explains, text widgets support escape sequences starting with '#', for
    example:

    #ff0000text results in a red 'text'.
    #{foobar} will be replaced with the value for 'foobar' in the
    MyGUI::LanguageManager.
    For OpenMW in particular, we have used a callback into the
    MyGUI::LanguageManager to implement the following meanings:

    #{setting=<section,setting>} will be replaced with the relevant setting
    value in the user's OpenMW settings.cfg.

    #{sCell=<cell id>} will be replaced with the translated name for a Morrowind
    cell (this is usually the same as the Cell ID, but the Russian edition of
    Morrowind uses a separate translation table)

    #{fontcolour=<name>} will be replaced with the color of
    FontColor_color_<name> in openmw.cfg (imported from Morrowind.ini). The
    output format is R,G,B with RGB ranging from 0 to 1.

    #{fontcolourhtml=<name>} is the same as above, except that the output format
    is a '#' followed by an HTML color code.

    #{<gamesetting>} will be replaced with the value of the Game Setting
    <gamesetting> in the Morrowind Data Files.
    Leveraging this replacement mechanism at runtime requires one to use the
    'setCaptionWithReplacing' method rather than 'setCaption'. Colour-codes
    (like #ff0000) are always used regardless of whether 'setCaption' or
    'setCaptionWithReplacing' is used. To use escape sequences in a layout one
    must use the 'Caption' property.

    To avoid '#' characters in a caption being treated as an escape sequence,
    this character needs to be escaped by adding another '#' character: '##'
    produces '#'. MyGUI provides the function MyGUI::TextIterator::toTagsString
    to do this. When retrieving text from a user-filled text box, you may want
    to do the opposite by calling getOnlyText().

    Escape sequences are also supported in skins. In order for this to work in
    legacy skins, the version must be set to '1.1'.

    Variables
      All attribute accesses are the modified (fortified/drained) value by
      default. Base attribute access is indicated by attributes starting with
      base.
      Attributes may be prefixed with pc or npc to indicate the owner of the
      attribute when opposing actors are involved.

    Calculation
      All numeric operations occur in floating point unless indicated.
      int(x) truncates.
      round(x) uses the default FPU rounding mode. [IEEE 754
      round-half-towards-even]
      roll(n) returns an integer from 0 up to but not including n.

  Enviroment allows each mw-subsystem to access any others subsystem's top-level manager class.
  namespace MWBase: base interface for all kinds of stuff?

  what's the different between world position and ESM::CellId ?
    float x, y; // world position
    typedef std::pair<int, int> CellId;

  when you search something, use lower case id.
