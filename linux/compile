gcc
    gcc use options like -a[bbrevation], you can not combine multiple option
    like -ab, you must use -a -b, they are totally different

library:
    libname.so.major.minor.rleasenumber         actural name
    libname.so.major                            so name
    libname.so                                  linker name

    when a new version of a shared library is released in order to fix bugs in
    a previous version, only the release number is incremented.

    When new functions are added to a shared library but existing functions in
    the library still provide the same interfaces, the minor version number is
    incremented and the release number is reset.

    When interfaces in functions in a shared library change in such a way that
    existing applications cannot call those functions, the major number is
    updated and the minor and release numbers are reset.

library dependences:
    ldd exe
    ldd might need to execute part of program to find dependencies
    use objdump if you don't trust the program

    objdump -p /path/to/program | grep NEEDED    the same as above

runtime library:
    ldconfig -v

static library:
    ar rcs libname.a obj.o
    ar -t name.a                        //get contents of static library

symbol:
    nm name.so                           //get symbols of shared library
