  Make sure you don't mix fileformat, some search patterns rely on it.
  you can use &filemormat option in vim to check fileformat.
  sometimes if your echo behaved weird, it might because your are handling a dos
  file and the "\r" cause echo to do weird stuff.

ssh:
  there are mainly two ways to use ssh:
    1: username,password, commonly used on unix system.
    2: public key authorization(commonly used in android system):
      use ssh-genkey to generate private and public key
      keep private key to your self, copy public key to server .ssh/authorized_keys

      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
      ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub username@ip_address // no username for android

android:
  you can install termux in your android to use it like linux:
    sshd
    passwd   // ???

  termux use 8022 as default port for ssh.

linux:
  check dir or file space usage : du -hs /etc
  You can use deja-dup to bakup, restore.
  You can restore a single file or directory : as deja-dup --restore

  You can use grep -A to print more lines after match.

  daemon:
    A daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process in
    multitasking computer operating system. Traditionally the process names of a
    daemon end with the letter d.
    Daemon is not attached to a tty, which means you can list deamon process as:
      ps -eo tty,pid,comm | grep ^?

    You can use initctrl to control init deamon?. 
      initctrl list
      initctrl status ssh-agent

  orphan process: parent dead, but still executing, adopted by init(pid 1).

  zombie(defunct) process : a process that has completed execution (via the exit
    system call) but still has an entry in the process table: it is a process in
    the "Terminated state". This occurs for child processes, where the entry is
    still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status:
    once the exit status is read via the wait system call, the zombie's entry is
    removed from the process table and it is said to be "reaped". A child
    process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the resource
    table. In most cases, under normal system operation zombies are immediately
    waited on by their parent and then reaped by the system – processes that
    stay zombies for a long time are generally an error and cause a resource
    leak. The kill command has no effect on zombie process.

  An orphan zombie process will be reaped automatically.

  terminal = tty = text input/output enviroment
  console = pyshical terminal

  shell is the outer most layer around the operating system kernel.
  There are two kinds of shell:
    command line interface(CLI).
    graphical user interface(GUI).
    
  there are two kinds of tty:
    hardware tty : one end connected to hardware, one end connected to software
    pesudo tty : both ends connected to software.

linux:
  swap works likes virtual memory on windows.

  device:
    a device file or special file is an interface for a device driver that
    appears in a file system as if it were an ordinary file. They allow software
    to interact with a device driver using standard input/output system calls,
    which simplifies many tasks and unifies user-space I/O mechanisms.

  There are two general kinds of device files in Unix-like operating systems:
    character devices(not used in linux):
      provide unbuffered, direct access to the hardware device.

    block device:
      provide buffered access to hardware devices, and provide some abstraction
      from their specifics. Unlike character devices, block devices will always
      allow the programmer to read or write a block of any size (including
      single characters/bytes) and any alignment. 

  Pseudo-devices: 
    Device nodes on Unix-like systems do not necessarily have to correspond to
    physical devices. Nodes that lack this correspondence form the group of
    pseudo-devices.

  Some of the most commonly used (character-based) pseudo-devices include:
    /dev/null – accepts and discards all input; produces no output (always
                returns an end-of-file indication on a read)
    /dev/zero – accepts and discards all input; produces a continuous stream of
                NUL (zero value) bytes
    /dev/full – produces a continuous stream of NUL (zero value) bytes when
                read, and returns a "disk full" message when written to

    /dev/random and /dev/urandom – they produce a variable-length stream of
                                   pseudo-random numbers.

  In Unix-like operating systems, a loop device, vnd (vnode disk), or lofi (loop
  file interface) is a pseudo-device that makes a file accessible as a block
  device. such as:
    mount -o loop /media/balabala /dsfsdf/sdf.iso

  linux style file system:
    inode:
      inode is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a
      filesystem object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the
      attributes and disk block location(s) of the object's data.Filesystem object
      attributes may include metadata (times of last change, access,
      modification), as well as owner and permission data.
      Every file has one inode.

    block:
      real file content, a file may take multiple blocks.

    directory:
      directy block stores child inode and their name(just like hard link),
      which means if you want to add/delete/rename a file in a directory, you
      need w privilege.

    link:
      hard link:
        simply add a new inode name pair in directory data block, no new inode
        created. You can only create hard link in the same filesystem. You can
        not create hard link for directory. 
      symbolic link:
        Add a new file, it's datablock is the target. It's a new file, it has
        it's own inode an datablock.

    number of hard links:
      a file has 1 hard link when it's created, it's stored in it's parent
      directory, it increases every time you create a hardlink for it. 

      a directory has 2 hard link when it's created, one in it's parent
      directory, one in special entry '.', whose inode is the directory it self.
      it also increases everytime you create a child directory in it, as special
      entry '..' of child directory will point to it's parent,

      top -o %MEM           # sort by %MEM
    top detail is hard to remember, htop is much more user friendly.

  schedule commands:
    scheduled commands is done via cron deamon on linux.
    you can use crontab -e to schedule your commands. Or you can add commands to
    /etc/cron.daily/ to execute command in preset schedule.

  find default port for service:

  The splash screen is the picture that you can see while Linux is booting.

  The framebuffer (fbdev) is a character device providing access to graphics
  hardware. 

  Although the Linux frame-buffer supports 256 (or more) colors, the Linux console
  driver does not; therefore, console applications are still limited to 16 colors
  on the Linux console, frame-buffer or not.

  change tty resolution:
    type vbeinfo or videoinfo in grub prompt to get supported resolution.(or use
    hwinfo --framebuffer)
    add following lines to /etc/default/grub
      GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080x32
      GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep

  always use max tty resolution:
      GRUB_GFXMODE=auto

  change tty text color:
    echo -en "\e]P0222222"
    # e]p is the "set color escape", color format is XRRGGBB

  get max color in current terminal:
    tput colors   # only 8 for tty, 256 for gnome terminal
