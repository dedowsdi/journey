xargs is used to read as many input as possible as command arguments, execute as
less commands as possible.

common use:
    seq 1 8 | xargs echo

execute command per record
    seq 1 8 | xargs -L 1

handle filename with whitespace
    find ~/journey/gl4 -type f -newermt '2018-09-13' ! -newermt '2018-09-14' -print0 | xargs -0 echo
    -print0 and -0 use null character as delimiter

rename .sh file
    ls * | xargs -I{} bash -c 'mv {} ${0#.sh}' {}
    be very careful that {} is literal string, not variable, don't use it with parameter expansion
