find regular files with specific name
    find ~/journey/linux -type f -name 'journey'

ignore permission warning
    find ~/ -type d -name 'journey' 2>/dev/null

find all .txt files, don't follow symbolic link
    find -P ~/journey/osg -name '*.txt'
    -P is default behavior

find all .txt files, don't follow symbolic link, case insensitive
    find -P ~/journey/osg -iname '*.txt'

find all .txt files, don't follow symbolic link, ignore build dir
    find -P ~/journey/osg ! -path '*/build/*' -a -name '*.txt'
    -a is default behavior
    -name match with trailing filename
    -path match with full path

find all .txt and .png files, don't follow symbolic link, ignore build dir
    find -P ~/journey/osg ! -path '*/build/*' -a \( -name "*.png" -o  -name "*.txt" \)

find all .txt files,  follow symbolic link, ignore build dir
    find -L ~/journey/osg ! -path '*/build/*' -name '*.txt'

find all files of which is modified after a certain files was last modified

    find ~/journey/gl4 -type f -newermt '2018-09-13' ! -newermt '2018-09-14' -exec ls -al '{}' \;

find and print with ls -al
    find ~/journey/linux -type f -name 'journey' -exec ls '{}' \;

seperate items by null character
    find ~/journey/gl4 -type f -size +8M -executable -print0

find at certain depth d
    find . -mindepth d -maxdepth d

find in dps
    find . -depth

exclude .git and .hg, don't descend into it
