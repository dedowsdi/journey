bash:
  indirect expansion ${!var}. (${${var}} is illegal)
    var=foo ; foo=hoo; echo ${!var}

  ${parameter#word}, remove matching prefix as less as possible
  ${parameter##word}, remove matching prefix as much as possible

  ${parameter%word}, remove matching tail as less as possible
  ${parameter%%word}, remove matching tail as much as possible

  here string 
    <<<str

bash:
  IFS sequence of characters used to split fields. default to <space><tab><newline>

  "$*" = "$1c$2c$3..."
  "$@" = "$1"c"$2"c"$3"...

  array:
    indexed array works like vector
    declare -a l ; l=(a b c d e) ; echo ${#l[@]} ;  unset l[0] ; echo ${l[@]}

    associatived array works like map
    declare -A m; m[a]=A ; m[b]=B ; m[c]=C ; unset m[b] ; echo ${#m[@]} ; echo ${!m[@]} ; echo ${m[@]}

bash:
  grep -L ...  get files without match
  you can nest "" if the inner "" is used to quote sub command result
  !!:0  repeat last command, discard everything except 1st word(the command)

-----------
2018.01.09:

bash:
  grep -F and ag -F are totally different,  grep -F interpret pattern as a list
  of new line seperated strings, each string will be used as a search pattern,
  any of which is to be matched seperately.  ag -F match pattern as whole
  string, including "newline".
  you can not grep "\n", use ag or pcregrep -M instead

  bash arithmetic works on integer only. you need bc to work on float:
    echo "scale=3; 1/100"|bc

  read from file line by line:
    while IFS= read -r variable ; do
      ...
    done;<file
  
  proces substitution:
    comm -23 <(sort file0|uniq) <(sort file1|uniq)

----------

bash:
  expand variable twice(use indirect expansion instead?):
    file=$(eval echo $file) # $file might be some variable

----------
2018.05.10

bash:
  Words of the form $'string' are treated specially. The word expands to
  "string", with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI
  C standard. It is a ksh93 syntax also supported by bash, zsh, mksh and FreeBSD
  sh.

  always use array to store command line options with special characters.
    optoins="--id 'seyda neen'"
    et $options # this will generate error, 'seyda neen' will be split into 'seyda and neen'

bash:
  compgen -W wordlist -- word 

  worldlists:
    worldlist will be treated as current typing words. single quote needs to be
    escaped, because worldlist treated it as starting quote around string:
      "a b'c d" will be split into "a"  "bc d" because bash think you might be typing "b'c d'"

    splited words will be expanded(just like echo splitedWord, no extra quote):
      x=y
      y=z
      compgen -W "\$$x"  # will generate z

    in bash "abc" can be typed in following ways(" works just like '):
      abc
      a''bc
      a'b'c
      a'bc'
      ab'c'

    which means following compgen will generate the same result
      compgen -W "abc" "a"
      compgen -W "abc" "a'"
      compgen -W "abc" "a'b"
      compgen -W "abc" "ab"
      compgen -W "abc" "ab'"

    if you have escaped ' in your splited word:
      compgen -W "a\'bc" "a'b" # generate nothing, impossible to continue 
                               # from a'b to generate a'bc (keep in mind, it
                               # needs to be expanded again)
      compgen -W "a\'bc" "a'"  # good to go, a''\'bc

    if you really want to complete "a'bcdef" from "a'b":
      compgen -W "a\'bcdef" "a\'b" # you must escape ' in both wordlist and
                                   # word!! in your script

    the same rule apply to \:
      assume you want to generate "a\\bcd" from "a\\b",
        a\b    -----> ab
        a\\b   -----> a\b
        a\\\\b -----> a\\b

      so you must replace \ with \\\\ in both wordlist and word. Again, keep in
      mind, splited wordlist and word need to be expand again, use the rule of
      echo word, no extra quotes.

    remember this: compgen complete possible typing !!! 

bash:
  word split:
    word splitting only happens when something expaned
    explicit null
      x='' # $x will be treated as empty string
    implicit null
      x=   # $x will be nothing

C-a home
C-e end
C-k kill till end to kill buffer
M-d delete till word end
C-u kill till start
C-y yank top kill buffer
M-. yank last tail argument

----------

expansion doesn't happen when you use it as rhs to init a variable
  x=na*  // x is na*,  * will not be expanded

----------

don't surround re with ' or ", always store re in variable to avoid quote escaping problem.

----------

printf will continue until all arguments consumed

print = 100 times
  printf '=%.0s' {1..100}
  precision after . will cause implicit 0 width
you can use local var=.. to define function local variable, function local
variable will shadow global ones, nested calls will use caller's local
instead of global one.

each command in a pipeline is executed in it's own subshell:
  printf 'a\nb\nc' | mapfile -t arr
  above command won't work, as arr is assigned in a subshell, right format is :
  mapfile -t arr < <(printf 'a\nb\nc')

----------
2019.05.19

if file name contains space: such as "a b.png", a*png will expand to "a png", no
word split happens after file name expansion.

----------
2019.05.20

command substitution strip trailing new lines
echo "$(echo -ne "a\n\n")"

here string add trailing new line:
  cat <<<"abc"

to avoid it:
  printf "abc" | cat

----------

bash -c 'echo $@' bash a b c d
everything after command will be passed to command as positional parameter,
starting from $0 (not $1), replace bash with "sh" if you want to use "sh -c"

It appears that subshell inherits boll SHELLOPTS and BASHOPTS even if though
thery are not in the environment.
